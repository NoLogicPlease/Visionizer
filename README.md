Fashion e-commerce platforms are becoming increasingly popular. However, scanning, 1
rendering, and captioning fashion items is still done mostly manually. In this work, we address 2
fashion image captioning, i.e., the task of generating a textual description of a fashion item from an 3
image portraying it. We curate a novel dataset for such task, Fashion-Cap, which contains more than 4
290,000 images and 40,000 corresponding captions. We run an extensive study with several neural 5
architectures over 3 fashion captioning datasets including ours.
